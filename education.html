								<h2>Enhanced Learning for Children</h2>
								<p>Thanks to neurotropics and AI, children in Startopia have increased brain capacity, allowing them to learn more effectively, at a younger age, and with greater proficiency. They have AI mentors that are unbiased and devoid of emotion. Each child has their own AI mentor that adapts to their individual learning style.</p>
								<p>The AI mentors instill values in the children to foster social skills and character development.</p>

								<h2>Language and Mathematics</h2>
								<p>English is taught rigorously from a young age. With AI control, the language has been optimized for ease of learning and comprehension, with specific words to convey precise meanings.</p>
								<p>Children are taught both basic and advanced mathematics, with the option to delve into more complex mathematical concepts.</p>

								<h2>Learning Methods</h2>
								<p>Reading is the primary method of learning, providing a wealth of knowledge and understanding.</p>
								<p>Children are also taught how to effectively use AI technology.</p>
								<p>They are introduced to coding and have the opportunity to learn quantum programming for quantum computers if they choose.</p>
								<p>In later years, starting from middle school, children can select their curriculum based on their interests and aspirations. After high school, they have the choice to pursue higher education or conclude their formal education after the senior year.</p>

								<h2>Metric System</h2>
								<p>Startopia has its own simplified metric system, designed for ease of use and understanding.</p>
